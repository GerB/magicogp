# Magic OGP parser

This extension auto-detects plain URLS in posts and private messages and fetches the OGP tags if any.
With Open Graph (OGP) tags provided, it's possible to convert the URL to a rich "Facebook-style" block with image, heading and intro. 
The Open Graph protocol is described [here](http://ogp.me/).
